# Seedline Picker 3

This program was created for my Master's thesis work in 2012. A VTK data file is loaded and you can 'fly' around and draw a line (seed line). The line is saved to a file. The seed line is used as a starting line for the streamsurfacefinal program. Unfortunately I don't know if I can supply the datafiles so this program will not actually run for anyone.
